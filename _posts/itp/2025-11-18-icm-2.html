                    I am convinced everything ties back to math. The way sound ties into waves and the impact of
                    frequency and timbre slightly blew my mind. I've also been aware that scales exist outside of
                    popular western music, but I haven't fully listened to scales from other countries.

                    For the project, at first we had a hard time approaching the brief and thinking what to do. After
                    exploring the P5 reference, we found the <code>PolySynth</code> class which made it easy to play
                    notes and transition across an array of notes. Jua had more experience with music and scales and put
                    together for our first iteration of the work.

                    Following the next class on sound, I felt we had to approach our project differently. Instead of
                    using the synth, we went back to the basics of using the P5 oscillator. Jua had the idea to use two
                    laptops and the sounds interacting with each other in space which was we decided to incorporate into
                    our final piece. Another idea we chose to incorporate came from jazz, and the idea of instruments
                    moving in and out of sync. With one laptop we wanted to keep a more steady rhythm, and the other
                    would change its tempo over time moving faster and slower. It took some experimenting changing the
                    pace of the music over the course of a minute moving along a sin wave at different rates. Each
                    laptop has the same notes in a scale, and similar scale ratios to create an interplay when the two
                    sin waves overlap.
