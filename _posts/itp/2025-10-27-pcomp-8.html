            Weeks 8 - Back at it

                <p>With midterms out of the way, the weekly labs and lessons are back. Except now, things are getting
                    more interesting: Linking physical computing and electronics to P5 and creative code. Personally, I
                    think there are a lot of interesting uses and proejcts I can make by combining these two skills, and
                    I'm looking forward to having time to explore them.

                    As for the labs, to play with an analog input to output to different serial devices, I decided to
                    test out a small joystick I found on the junk shelf a few weeks ago. (I have no use for the joystick
                    yet but I may one day which is why I grabbed it). This one probably the hardest part of the lab just
                    making sure the joystick was working and checking the data sheet. Not because it was difficult, but
                    because the power supply I was using was loose in an outlet so it took 45min debugging different
                    potential bugs.

                    Eventually though the circuit was successsfully set up.

                    I found the labs really straight forward and I bookmarked the pages since I will definitely reuse
                    the boilerplate code used to link P5 and electronics.
