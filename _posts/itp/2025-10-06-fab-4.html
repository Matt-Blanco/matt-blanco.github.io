                    Like every week, coming up with an idea has been the hardest part of the project. Last week, I made
                    a common item useless, so I decided the next thing I made could not be another useless item. It had
                    to have a useless purpose. Eventually though, an idea dawned on me: An enclosure that can fit a
                    single sheet of paper. Something simple but absurd in a fun way.

                    During Intro to Fab last week, I had noticed a large unclaimed piece of wood in the basement wood
                    shop, and knew it would be a great piece of material for this week's project. Before going into
                    actually making the object, I decided the goal would be make an enclosure using wood and acrylic to
                    create the best possible single paper holder I could make. Next, I spent lots of time sketching and
                    measuring before I even thought about cutting into my material. I wanted my cuts to be precise. The
                    absuridty of this idea centered on the execution and presentation of the sheet of paper.

                    Another challenge for myself during this project was tp use the router. A tool Phil demonstrated to
                    us, and a tool that seemed very useful for hollowing and rounding edges on a piece of wood. Ian and
                    the shop staff were very helpful instructing how to use the router and the steps to create a guide
                    to create an inner 1/8" depth. Perhaps out of order, the next step of my process was laser engraving
                    the space for the sheet of paper. After some trial, error, and wrong laser cut marks, Ian helped me
                    manually center and focus the laser cutter to text engrave an 8.5" x 11" rectangle in the center of
                    the enclosing. At the same time, I laser cut a transparent acrylic pane to act as my lid for the
                    enclosure.

                <p>
                    While my lid was the perfect dimensions and I had sketched out, it didn't fit into the enclosure to
                    do imperfect edges. When I initially used the router I several of my edges weren't straight and I
                    did not cut to the border I had marked in case I messed up my cut. So I went back the router and
                    attempted to clean up the frame. I carefully measured and created a new guide to so I wouldn't
                    overshoot my border. While precarious, I managed to clean up two of the four edges of the page
                    frame. I was terrified I would mess up my wood and would have to start all over again with a back-up
                    piece I had cut. To prevent going back to square one, I found a sharp chisel in the basement and
                    used it to extend the edge of the frame to my measurements and create 90ยบ corners that the router
                    could not do. By some miracle the lid fit perfectly into the frame with less than 1/8" gap.

                <p>
                    I could have stopped there, but I was having a lot of fun with the enclosure and I wanted the lid to
                    have a cleaner fit and not fall out as easily. Ian had given me some tiny neodymium magnets to use
                    and loaned me plastic drill bits to cut through my acrylic, and so I used a 5/8" bit in my acrylic
                    and wood to pressure fit magnets together.
