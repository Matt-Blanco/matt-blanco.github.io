                    Going into the assignment I was stuck on what to experiment with. I had re-created the ideas of
                    vectors
                    before in custom classes usualling including an X and Y field to easily track positions of many
                    elements. And including the vector math will help a lot going forward for more complicated sketches.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eventually, I came to the idea to simply play with elements orbiting the mouse with the elements
                    easing from the previous mouse position to the new one. Also to make it harder for myself I wanted
                    to make it in 3D space.
                </p>

                <p>
                    First I just rendered points moving randomly in 3D space. Each point was given a random vector
                    position along with a random X, Y, and Z vector between (-1,1). To better show depth and perspective
                    the sketch, I added in boundary lines and rotated the camera to see the points move across all axes.

                <p>
                    My next step was to add in mouse interactivety to the system. And so I attempted to add an easing
                    function to each point so they would gradually move towards the mouse position. After taking into
                    account the difference of WEBGL mode in P5, the movement was still not quite right, but it did lead
                    to some interesting visuals as clusters of points all move towards the same point.

                <p>
                    I took a step back to thing about how to first have the points orbit a point in space. I had to
                    think back to high school geometry and learned instead of setting an initial position vector, I can
                    set an initial theta and phi angles of each point towards the origin in order to calculate each
                    points' orbit. So I placed a sphere at the sketches' origin to demonstrate what all the points were
                    orbiting.

                <p>
                    To avoid any complicated math as the mouse moved, I used <em>push()</em> and <em>pop()</em> to
                    translate the origin to the mouse position before drawing the sphere and each orbiting point. It
                    didn't create the easing effect I was initially looking for but the sketch had become a mixture of
                    what I had inteded and happy accidents as I altered different parameters.
