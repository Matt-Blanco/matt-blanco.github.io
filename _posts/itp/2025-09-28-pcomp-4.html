                    This week I took my Physical Computing work in a more relaxed manner and decided to focus on some of
                    my other courses (specificall Into to Fabrication). The concepts from the lab I already felt fairly
                    familiar with since it related to programming concepts I have worked with a lot. In week 2, I had
                    already experimented with sensing different types of button presses and working with different input
                    states, and I think the ideas are heavily related to a way of programmatic thinking I am comfortable
                    with.

                    I'm beginning to connect everything I'm learning and practicing to my other courses and vice-versa.
                    As my fabrication skills are getting better I want to make well-made enclosings and objects to hold
                    my future physical computing projects, and I'm excited to connect the work with more of my coding
                    skills (and eventually more creative coding work).
