            Week 2 - Getting Comfortable

                    I had a lot of fun with this week's project. At first I struggled to come up with an idea that
                    matched my
                    theme, but then I had the idea to make chairs and immediately knew that's what I had to make. After
                    all,
                    designers often obsess over chairs as an example of all the ways you can create new forms to do
                    something so
                    simple, and while some may say it's not absurd I would argue otherwise. With my object set, I now
                    had to
                    figure out how to make them. I managed to find a good piece of scrap wood
                    in the Fab Lab and set about sketching out the chairs.

                <p>
                    With all my other coursework I wanted to strike a balance to not spend too much time in the Fab Lab,
                    so I
                    opted for a simpler design with many 90ยบ edges. After the sketch my first step was to cut pieces of
                    wood
                    that would eventually turn into the chairs. First I cut my wood into two havles, then clamping a
                    stop block
                    to the compound miter saw I cut six pieces of 3.5' by 1.5' pieces of wood.

                </div>
                <p>
                    After I had my pieces of wood I chose to cut the chair back and seat next. In hindsight, I should
                    have cut
                    the chair legs out next, but I knew if would be the hardest part of the object so I opted for the
                    easier cut
                    for now. Using the pre-made wooden bandsaw track I clamped a piece of wood with a 0.25" gap before
                    the saw
                    and cut six chairs (one I used to test all the cuts first). I then moved the stop block to cut a
                    cube off of
                    each piece.

                <p>
                    Next using the bandsaw again with a 0.25" stop block, I made cuts for the legs however it did little
                    to cut
                    out the bottom of the chair. Nonetheless I made the cuts for the legs before consulting the shop
                    staff and
                    the best options for removing the excess wood. Audrey Oh suggested using the small bandsaw to
                    diagonally cut
                    the excess wood and once I removed as much as possible to use the dremel with the metal head to even
                    out the
                    bottom.

                <p>
                    After carefully using the small bandsaw and a lot of dremeling, All of the chairs looked like
                    chairs. My
                    hand was sore from. trying to be precise with the dremel and prevent myself from accidentally
                    removing wood
                    from the chair legs. The dremel also caused the most uncertainty and unevenness in the objects.
                    While they
                    all had the same dimensions, each had their own imperfections. All in all, I enjoyed this project
                    and
                    something about the tiny chairs brought me a lot of joy. Especially
                    seeing how other people reacted to them or would come by my work table just to stack them up. It may
                    lead to
                    a change in my theme, but I haven't decided yet.
