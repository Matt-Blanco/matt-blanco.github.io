            Weeks 5-8 - The Midterm
        </h3>

                <p>
                    Coming to ITP, the physical computing classes had been highlighted as one of the star pieces of the
                    program. The course midterm had also been highly talked about because of the consistent Halloween
                    theme (since the class' midterm always falls close to Halloween). Jules, Michael, and I decided to
                    work together to come up with a project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the initial stage we were brainstorming some ideas we've had for a halloween themed project,
                    these are a few of the thoughts we've had in mind:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A Jack in the box - something with a jump scare effect, perhaps with a sound played through an
                        SD card connected to the arduino, maybe LEDs lighting up from some take on a jack O' lantern and
                        other clich√©s. We had an idea that the scary thing in the box could be pumpkin spice, maybe
                        thrown at the user but we abandoned the idea since it was to scary.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Trick or treat oriented project where the user picks up candies and they scream or beg for help.
                        we thought about using pressure sensors and attach each one a specific voice recording which it
                        activates. we weren't sure how to present it though, we thought it might be weird to present
                        only a few candies that the users can pick up to make sounds, something felt unclear about the
                        idea, but we did like the concept of creating sound via pressure sensors. Another version of the
                        same idea was having a basket full of candies the makes different spooky sounds.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Creating a frustrating claw machine that do not collect anything (sounded a bit like the usual
                        ones) and makes mean sounds.
                        <div class="mb-2 col-6 mx-auto">
                            <img src="/assets/images/itp-blog/pcomp/midterm//4f4da0_952f72785361425ea6771979cdfe652b~mv2.avif"
                                class="img-fluid">
                        </div>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The last idea that was actually building off of the second idea was creating a stage where
                        poeple can place different objects (we still weren't sure what) on platforms with load cells
                        pressure sensors to generate different halloween sounds. The Idea was that there will be several
                        platforms and it will allow a group of people to play the instrument together using differnt
                        objects with different weights to generate sounds. Maybe some sort of a kids instrument for
                        intreducing them to halloween.
                        <div class="mb-2 col-6 mx-auto">
                            <img src="/assets/images/itp-blog/pcomp/midterm/4f4da0_a0ba8f0540c64274afcc60062934669f~mv2.avif"
                                class="img-fluid">
                        </div>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>

                    We moved on with the last idea. we decided to build the device like a small stage of a halloween
                    festival not sure if we should decorate it like a halloween lawn or a pile of hay with haloween
                    items decorating it. We agreed to move on with the technical side and start testing the pressure
                    sensors.
                    We soldered the load cells so we can connect it to the arduino, and later discovered that they
                    work best when attached halfway to an object having half of the surface exposed and free to
                    bend. After testing the sensors can read pressure value properly we went on to build the mockup
                    for the stage so we can start testing the interaction of the instrument with different items.

                    For the music part we tried using the Mozzi library but didn't have a lot of sucsses with that. As
                    an alternative we created some manipulations on regular tones so they would last longer. so the
                    noteDuration is longer, it has a vibrato to make a more halloween-ish sound and detuneRange to give
                    the sound a wobbly effect. the detune constantly bends the pitch of the the tone played. Here is the
                    test on FSR's. each sensor is genereting a different octave in order to expend the available tones
                    users can provoke.
                </p>

                </div>
                <p>
                    The result was a sound of a halloween themed old computer game that we liked and it felt like it
                    fits the concept of a children instrument. Testing the sounds on the mockup:
                </p>
                <div class="mb-2 col-6 mx-auto">
                    <video class="img-fluid" src="/assets/images/itp-blog/pcomp/midterm/load-cell-sound.mp4"></video>
                </div>
                <p>
                    One of the reasons we chose using small items to provoke the sensor was that the load cells are
                    really sensitive and were concerned they might break. Later on we realized we can secure the load
                    cells and we are less limited about pressure inflicted on them. We decided to change the interface
                    so the user will use the hands to activate the sensors. We started designing the wooden stage/box
                    and taking hand measures for the fabrication part.

                </div>
                <p>
                    Then we started designing sticker to for the hands to make it more appealing:

                        class="img-fluid">
                </div>
                <p>
                    Which later evolved to this after a cleaner design in Photoshop and textures with AI:
                </p>
                <div class="mb-2 col-6 mx-auto">
                    <img src="/assets/images/itp-blog/pcomp/midterm/4f4da0_5f976875e4dd425d837da74012cc64f7~mv2.avif"

                </div>
                <p>
                    And this is the simulation for the final decoration:
                </p>
                <div class="mb-2 col-6 mx-auto">
                    <img src="/assets/images/itp-blog/pcomp/midterm/4f4da0_84fd34f6c84a462f8ce478b4aa403e01~mv2.avif"

                </div>
                <p>
                    Next step was setting up the enclosure and securing the load cell and screwing the amps to the sides
                    of the box:
