                <p>TLDR: I killed my Arduino</p>
                <p>But first let me explain how we got here.</p>
                <p>
                    The week started out with a lot of midterm project progress. As a group, Mikhail, Jules, and I met
                    several times to refine our idea and begin prototyping and testing. Several load cell sensors I
                    ordered from Amazon arrived, and we had to test them to to see if the would actually work for our
                    project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While already had a strong concept for our project, we still had details to work out. Such as, how a
                    viewer place objects onto each pressure board, and if the objects would start on the board or in a
                    small basket next to the platform itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal of the midterm work session was to prototype and get the sensors working. Once we knew we
                    could properly measure the weights of different objects, then we'll work to connect it so sound
                    through the tone or Mozzi libraries.
                </p>
