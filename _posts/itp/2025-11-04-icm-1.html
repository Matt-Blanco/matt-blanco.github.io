                    The concept began as a combination of ideas between Lucas and myself. I thought it would be
                    interesting to explore landscape photography and creating alternate realities based on landscapes
                    from around the world, and Lucas had described the feeling of sleep paralysis and the reality you
                    become stuck in when you wake up without agency over your body. We decided to combine the ideas by
                    using imagery from a dangerous hike I completed in 2022 with feelings of it not ending and becoming
                    trapped.

                    The image we chose depicts a bridge crossing the San Joaquin river along the John Muir Trail. In
                    2022, the bridge was damaged in an avalanche causing it to be more dangerous to cross with hikers
                    having to traverse a jungle gym to get to the other side. The National Park Service decided to blow
                    up the bridge and rebuild it only a few days after I had crossed.
