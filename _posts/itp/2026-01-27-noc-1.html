            Week 1 - Nature is Chaos
        </h3>

                For the first week of the class it felt fitting for nature to be about randomness, and how randomness
                can emulate motion. For the project, at first I thought about creating a system to emulate <em>slime
                    mold</em> since the fungi has been used to create mechanical systems (like Tokyo's subway).

                After thinking on the project for an evening, I decideed to change course and attempt to use randomness
                on an area I know well: cartographic maps
            </p>
            <p>
                I wanted to experiment to see if a randomwalker could be used to create a generative topographic and a
                trail through the speculative mountain range.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the end I was happy with how the piece turned out. With more time (and understanding of object
                boundaries and organic shapes). I broke the project down into incremental parts:

            <ol>
                <li>Drawing organic shapes (as mountain peaks) that would not overlap</li>
                <li>Randomly setting starting and ending points for the trail</li>
                <li>Drawing a random noise path from the starting point</li>
                <li>Re-learning geometry and drawing a slop between the start and end</li>
                <li>Incorporating guided randomness to add variability to the slope</li>
            </ol>
            Originally I wanted to have the trail avoid and move around mountain peaks, but after thinking, many of my
            most favorite trails pass across peaks so I left kepy the functionality as it is. With more time I would
            like to add more variability and curves to the trail. At the moment is still feels very straight.
