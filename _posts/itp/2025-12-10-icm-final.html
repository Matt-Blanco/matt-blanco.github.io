                <p>
                    For starters, I am glad I followed the advice I heard to take the second half of ICM. Through talks
                    with Arjun and seeing how others approach code, it made me realize that my approach to programming
                    is very structured and it is sometimes hard for me to think of new creating computing projects.

                    That being said, what Arjun and I came up with made me excited. Though I only wish we both had more
                    time to devote to the work. We began with finding where out interests overlapped and what ideas we
                    wanted to explore. Arjun had done previous work on <em>n=4</em>. A project to determine all the
                    different permeutations of the letter 'a' that were still readable as an a within for lines. Our
                    goal started to expand this idea to a whole alphabet of latin characters and introducing 3D space.

                <p>
                    With the new layers of complexity, we new we had to include a more robust type set instead of four
                    line letters, so we spent time drawing out different letter versions on grid paper debating if we
                    need ascenders and descenders, or if all letters can be in lowercase or not. After many compromises
                    and debates we found some middle ground.

                <p>
                    Through the midst of other finals, we both found time to implement our shared exploration. Arjun
                    used a single letter and shifted its points throughout Z-space overtime. Meanwhile, I went for a
                    more holistic approach thinking about how someone would type.

                    The code breakdown:
                </p>
                <p>
                    My first thought was that each letter would exist in a 3x3 grid, and that each point in the grid
                    would need to be calculated based on a starting point. So I begain my sketch by making a
                    <code>grid</code> class and drew a new empty grid whenever a key was pressed. Next I had to apply
                    the actual letters to each grid. To draw each letter, I created an array of rules. Every letter has
                    a set of rules which describes the lines between two points to draw. For example, an "O" would have
                    eight elements in its rules array:
                </p>
                <code>
                    [
                        { start: "p1", end: "p2"},                        
                        { start: "p1", end: "p4"},
                        { start: "p2", end: "p3"},
                        { start: "p3", end: "p6"},
                        { start: "p6", end: "p9"},
                        { start: "p9", end: "p8"}
                        { start: "p7", end: "p8"}
                    ]
                </code>
                <p>
                    I had created an initial set of rules for a handful of letters to test the code, but Arjun had done
                    a lot of the work refining the rules and filling out the alphabet. While adding all the rules, I
                    also incorporated logic to delete characters with "backspace" along with a blinking cursor to follow
                    the next letter to orient where someone would type.
                </p>

                    The most difficult part of the process was rotating each word and the canvas to new orientations.
                    Not only would each word have its own depth, but every new word could exist on a diferent plane than
                    the previous word. Trying to visualize how the canvas would rotate broke my brain but Arun helped as
                    much as he could.

                    The end result turned into an architecture of typography. Slightly legible, but more interesting in
                    the final form than anything else.
