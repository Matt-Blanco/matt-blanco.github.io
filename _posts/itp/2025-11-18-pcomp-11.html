            Weeks 10 - Learning to Model

                Throughout the week there wasn't any new physical computing concepts that I worked on. However, I did
                spend a large amount of time iterating and experimenting on forms for the final. I forced myself to
                learn Fusion360, and to better understand 3D modeling and begin testing the project concept in general.

                Jules and I made the decision to order a stronger electromagnet and a pre-fabricated ferrofluid display.
                Utimately, attempting to engineer our own display would have been very time-consuming. With the help of
                Amazon, the display and electromagnet arrived fairly quick and we could begin prototyping and iterating.
                I was under the impression that we would need a play-test by next week (11/18), so I was trying to
                quickly iterate as much as possible beforeI left the city for the weekend.
