                    This week's lab helped inspire me with potential ideas for future projects. Implementing the analog
                    tone speaker and servo was quite fun and straightforward. I managed to get away with bending some
                    stripped wires around the speaker connections instead of soldering it to save time on the labs. Last
                    week's class helped solidify the differences between digital and analog pins, and the relationship
                    between the Arduino code and the hardware it operates.

                    While I was able to correctly set up the speaker lab, I ran into trouble when I attempted to
                    increase the speaker's power and volume. I added a 10V capacitor to my circuit and a ~4000 Ohm
                    resistor (calculated using Ohm's Law) but after using a multi-meter, the circuit still read 3V and
                    the speaker sounded just about the same.

                    Meanwhile, the servo helped show me new ways I can create movement in future physical computing
                    systems. The rotation of the servo didn't seem like much though I know it has a lot of possiblities
                    especially when an analog output is used on different types of motors. My next goal will be to try
                    and find time to experiment with creating more complex circuits.
