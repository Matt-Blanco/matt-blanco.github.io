                    Going into class I had come up with an idea for the curcious cube project, and I spent the week
                    prototyping a circuit and mechanism to make sure the idea was possible.
                </p>
                <h4>The goal</h4>
                <p>
                    For the project, I want to create a cube that responded to a person's proximity. Each face of the
                    cube would be made of a series of vertical panels that rotated 90º. Inside the cube would be a
                    speaker whose sound would change based on how physically open the cube is. The goal is to experiment
                    with materiality of sound and the experience a person can have modifying it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since the project, which I'm considering a 'sound sculpture', is complex for the midterm I will only
                    focus on moving a single face of the cube. Each process of the sculpture will be iterative and as
                    each piece comes together it will inform the next. The mechanical mechanism for the face panels will
                    be the most difficult so I started the week prototyping how it could work.

                    Luckily, in my Energy course we are also working on a project to convert kinetic energy into
                    electrical energy, and for that project I am also working with mechanical motion (just in a
                    different way). In Energy I need a large gear to conert more torque to move a smaller gear faster.
                    Meanwhile for the cube I will need gears that are the same size to transfer an equal rotaitonal
                    movement.

                    Focusing on the the cube and each panel, as a person approaches the cube a motor or servo would need
                    to rotate 90º. I believe a servo would work best since it has more control over the position of the
                    gear and it already works in angles. First, looking back into my pcomp labs I set up a servo to be
                    controlled by a potentiometer.

                    The next part was adding in a proximity sensor. I picked up an ultrasonic sensor since it has a good
                    sensing range and I would want a person to approach the cube from a wide angle rather than straight
                    on. Setting up the sensor was harder than I thought. The pcomp lab seems outdated and with the code
                    example the distance readings were really inconsistent with the sensor. I ended up finding a library
                    called New Ping which aims to simplify ultrasonic sensor readings and it worked much better.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another problem I ran into was that the servo and sensor combination was drawing more currant than
                    an external power supply could provide. For now, the servo is being powered by external power, and
                    the proximity sensor is relying on the Arduino's 5v Vin pin. However, I'd like both to be powered by
                    the power supply eventually.

                    With the circuit made, I pivoted to creating a prototype mechanism to test how the servo could
                    rotate a gear. Using scrap material by the laster cutters I found enough material to make a box and
                    two gears. The box's height was fit to the servo so the gear could be as close to the ground as
                    possible. Another gear was mounted to a dowel which was cut to the same height as the servo so both
                    gears could be aligned. Since I used scrap wood, the plywood was slightly warped so the gear's teeth
                    did not alsoway fit perfectly. Though I was surprised to see the system actually work.
