        <h5>Background</h5>
        <p>
            Banca Intesa Processes is an exploratory business analytics application that allows the organization to
            explore and audit risk management data to understand and manage the complexity. The application affords
            users a visual understanding of how risk is distributed across organizational structures and how activities
            are distributed among different actors at the company. Additionally, users can identify activities and
            associated risks without appropriate controls and develop plans to redistribute workflows.
        </p>
        <p>
            The power behind the design of this application is its minimal interface design that facilitates user
            interaction. A query status pane allows users to filter, zoom, and highlight specific attributes of the
            visualizations. Additionally, navigational controls create a visualization-first user experience by hiding
            all non-visualization components on the screen.

            The plaform was split into a series of three different visualizations each with their own filters and unique
            interactions. The circle packing visualization was used to identify different processes and sub-processes
            within the bank, the entwork graph was used to explore activities and risks, and the ranking graph to see
            activities distributed across the bank's actors.
