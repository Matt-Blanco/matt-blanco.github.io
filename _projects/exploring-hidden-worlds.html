        <h5>Background</h5>
        <p>
            The project first began as an idea in 2021 with a simple question: How can code be easier to understand?
            Frustrated by the learning process at several internships and seeing friends struggle with the linear
            process of traditional programming practice I wanted to imagine something new. Fast-forward three years and
            in my final two semesters at Northeastern University I finally felt I had to
            skills to accomplish my goal. Beginning as a seft-directed Honors in the Discipline project and supported by
            PEAK Summit Award from the Office of Undergraduate Research and Fellowship, and under the advising of Todd
            Linkner, I had the freedom and funding to
            iterate and turn my idea into a reality.

    <h5>The Vision</h5>
    <p>
        Inspired by the quote "Any sufficiently advanced technolgoy is indistinguishable from magic." by Arthur C.
        Clarke was my guiding mantra when I started working. I wanted to create something new and push against
        traditional methods of coding to invoke curiosity and platfulness. After resarching and conducting a literature
        review on current methods of visualizing codeThe original goal was to have files act as
        "solar systems" and the closer you zoomed into a

    <h5>As Pedagogy</h5>
    <p>
        The visualization and encoding system can also be used to help teach people about object-oriented and other
        heirarchical design systems within code. By seeing how aspects of scope are nested within one another it can be
        easier to understand intangible code.
