            The piece was showcased at NYU's Interactive Telecommunications 2025 Winter Show and created as the final
            project for Introduction to Physical Computing in ITP, the brief was to create a
            project that built on the physical computing concepts we had learned over the course of the semester. The
            idea originated as a play on the ways our smartphones are purposefully designed to be addictive.

            The P.E.D is not meant to replace a smartphone but act as a supplement to it. Its handheld design makes it
            portable and easy to take around while subverting the need to take out a phone when a dull moment occurs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Every time a note is played, the ferrofluid display pulses (due to a hidden electromagnet) and a haptic
            motor is activated creating a multi-sensory experience for anyone holding the device.
        </p>
        <p>
            The form of the device was created based on the sizes of the components inside, with the goal to make it as
            small as possible to be handheld.
        </p>
        <p>
            The P.E.D has four main interactions:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Each button plays a note from two different octaves.
            </li>
            <li>
                Octaves can be changed by pressing down on the knob
            </li>
            <li>
                Rotating the knob both plays a note and changes which notes the buttons play and the speed of the
                ferrofluid display
            </li>
            <li>
                The toggle switch enables a 'demo mode' controlling the device on its own
            </li>
        </ol>
