        <h5>Background</h5>
        <p>
            We are all aware our data is being collected. From Google, Meta, Apple, Amazon, you name it. Yet many people
            aren't aware of what kind of data is collected, and especially what it can do. <em>eyeWatch</em> imagines a
            speculative service where our collected data is put front and center. The service partners with big data
            companies to aggregate user data into a front-facing app providing an analysis of a user's information,
            while offering a series of sponsored recommendations to alter user behavior.
            A single design intervention cannot make people care about their digital data, but an intervention, of an
            absurd service, can begin to shed a light and help make people understand their data better.

            conceptual mockups</em></p>
