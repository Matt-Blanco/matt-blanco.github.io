        <p>
            <em>Surfs Up</em> attempts to bridge the gap between our natural and built environment by visualizing wave
            data from
            Nazar√©, Portugal, a popular big wave surfing location. With the help of the visualization the ocean is
            brought closer to Linz serving as a reminder of its importance to the world as a whole. The piece fades
            between spaced out pillars representing waves that follow mathematical calculations into smoother natural
            movements connecting digital world to the movements of the ocean.

            While assisting the Ars Electronica FutureLab on a four day workshop helping a group of students from
            Northeastern University design and develop their own facade designs, I found time to put together and
            present my own work. I chose to keep the project within a simple scope to play with the unique spatial
            elements the building offers and imagine how data might be represented in the large and low-resolution
            environment.
