    <p>
      Matt Blanco is a designer who uses technology and visualization as a means to rethink our perceptions of information. 
      While studying a combination of computer science and graphic design he combines the two disciplines in a way to explore new representations for information.
      All to make the world around us slightly easier to understand. 
      <br><br>
      Outside of his academic and career work, he is an avid adventurer taking time to explore different corners of the natural world through multi-week long backpacking trips. All captured on 35mm film photography.
