  <p id="about">
    I'm a designer, developer, & adventurer who uses design as a lens to look at how people interact with information.
    Currently I am a pursuing my masters at NYU in the Interactive Telecommunication Program where I am experimenting
    with new ways of interacting with code and data. I have been previously affiliated with <a

    <a href="https://camd.northeastern.edu/center-for-design/">Center for Design</a> as a student researcher,
    and the <a target="_blank" className="AboutLink" href="https://vis.csail.mit.edu/">Visualization Group</a> at MIT
