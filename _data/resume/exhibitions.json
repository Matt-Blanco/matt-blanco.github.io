        "description": "Stretching across a 23-meter-long wall, this critical visualization unpacks the curatorial process behind the exhibition Intelligens. Natural. Artificial. Collective. From the nexus, threads representing the selected applications and projects extend, unfolding through the interpretative dimensions of curation. Ethnographic insights, presented as excerpts from interviews, further enrich the narrative by adding depth and context."
