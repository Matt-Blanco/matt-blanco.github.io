Software should not be created behind closed doors especially when it can have larger ramifications on our day-to-day lives. Exploring Hidden Worlds aims to lift the veil on what it takes to build modern software through an explorable 3D visualization. Through learning what it takes to build modern software, and having the ability to understand it people can have more agency when deciding whether to adopt new, potentially harmful, technologies.",
