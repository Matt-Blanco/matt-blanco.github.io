        "description": "We are becoming more dependent on technology, and yet fewer people know how it works. Software should not be created behind closed doors especially when it can have larger ramifications on our day-to-day lives. Exploring Hidden Worlds aims to lift the veil on what it takes to build modern software through an explorable 3D visualization. Through learning what it takes to build modern software, and having the ability to understand it people can have more agency when deciding whether to adopt new, potentially harmful, technologies.",

An open-source library for converting data visualizations into accessible text structures for screen reader users. Starting with an existing visualization specification created with a supported toolkit, Olli produces a keyboard-navigable tree view with descriptions at varying levels of detail. Users can explore these structures both to get an initial overview, and to dive into the data in more detail.",
